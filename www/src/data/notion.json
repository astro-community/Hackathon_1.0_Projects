It has huge benefit on working with popular component framework as React, Vue which I don't find it with 11ty in the past. So building static site that generates a lot of data is definitely suited for Astro. For some use case that requires complex interactivity on client side I think I have to choose between Astro and NextJS. Still some bugs along development but so far so good.\nThanks Astro project and community! üôÇ",

      "Description": "WHEW. This project was a HUGE learning experience for me, speaking in terms of Astro. Not only did I experiment with Astro's experimental server-side rendering and new Vercel integration, but I also built the first application that uses Prisma ORM (https://prisma.io/) and is deployed to Vercel (https://vercel.com/). MAN, I just don't have enough words to thank the people who helped me deploy my application. It was a pretty tedious process which took over 10 hours, and I'm thankful to everyone who helped me helped me it ‚ù§Ô∏è. Now enough of the Sirius (pun intended :p) talk, let's get into what the app is, and how it functions!\nBasically, the app is a small gallery of things that I've always kept in Figma (you can find a link on the GitHub repo), but I wanted to make it public so others can learn off of my design work, and my approach around designing components. BUT - any good application needs at least some sprinkle of gamification, which is where Astro's server-side rendering comes in. I have a few fun eyeballing games at the end of this whole library, where you have to try and toggle some inputs to properly estimate certain CSS values in a particular HTML element. I've even built a leaderboard for all of this using Astro's server side rendering feature with Prisma and MongoDB!",
