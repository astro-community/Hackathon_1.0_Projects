# Hackathon_1.0_Projects

General Repository containing demonstrations of each Astro Hackathon 1.0 submissions.

Over a period of 4 weeks, with a grand total of $15K worth of prizes to give away between 3 categories. 

Astro's inaugrial Hackathon project was a resounding success. 

With over 30 different integrations, themes and SSR applications have ended up being submitted over the period of the hackathon process. 

We want to help showcase the fantastic work that each of the project authors have put into over this period.

We also want you to decide who will win a share of the awards!

To this end, we have setup up this monorepo to help you explore each of the projects in more detail and to serve as a reference guide in utilising these fantastic community created projects.
